# Drowsiness-Detection
A Drowsiness Detection system made from openCv and dlib libraries for detecting whether you are active, drowsy or sleepy!

(P.S. You would also require a file named shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat in the same folder as main.py, which will be used for detectting the landmarks on the face. I could not include it here as it its too big in size.)
